My Love, My Ruchika ❤️🥰

I don’t think words will ever be enough to tell you how much I love you 💖, but I’ll still try. You are my heart, my soul, my everything 💑💞. Every single day, I fall more in love with you, and I know deep inside that I want to spend the rest of my life with you 💍👰.

Yes, baby, I want to marry you! 💒💘 I want to wake up next to you every morning, hold you close every night, and build a beautiful life together. I dream of the day we call each other husband and wife 💏. And one day, I want us to have the most adorable little kids together 🍼👶—our own tiny versions running around, filling our home with love, laughter, and happiness. A life with you is the only future I want. 💕✨

I know there will be times when we fight 🤷‍♂️😤, moments when we don’t talk much 🤐, and days when things aren’t perfect 💔. But love, that’s okay. Because true love isn’t about never fighting—it’s about never giving up on each other, no matter what. And I will never give up on us, because you are my forever 💖💞.

And the best part? We’re meeting soon! 🤗💃 I can’t wait to finally hold you tight, kiss you softly 😘, and look into your beautiful eyes 😍. No more distance, no more waiting—just you and me, together, the way we’re meant to be.

Ruchika, I love you more than anything in this world! ❤️💫 You are my one and only, my soulmate, my future wife, my everything! Always and forever! 💖🔥💍
